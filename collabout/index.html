			<p>	Planning dinner or organizing a grocery trip shouldn't
				require a massive, expensive project management tool.
			</p>
			<p> 90% of the time, all you really need is a fast way to 
				keep track of what everyone is doing, and a way to make
				quick decisions.  That's why during a 24-hour Facebook
				Hackathon, we built this service that makes it simple
				to create synced, shareable to-do lists and polls.
			</p>
			<p> We think you're going to love it.</p>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h3>Features</h3>
			<p> So, how does it work?  All you have to do is
				create a page, and then send collaborators a link.
				Everything people put on the project page is synced live.
				That means you can:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li> Watch as people check off tasks, live.</li>
				<li> Add polls to decide on meeting times, locations, and more</li>
				<li> Access everything from any smartphone.</li>
			</ul>
