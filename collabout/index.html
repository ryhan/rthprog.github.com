			<p>	Planning dinner or organizing a grocery trip shouldn't
				require a massive, expensive project management tool.
			</p>
			<p> We noticed that 90% of the time, all we really needed 
				was a way to keep track of what everyone was doing,
				as well as way to make quick decisions. So, we built this 
				service in 24 hours at a Facebook hackathon
				to make it simple to create 
				synced, shareable to-do lists and polls.
			</p>
			<p> We think you're going to love it.</p>

			<h3>Features</h3>
			<p> Just create a page, and send collaborators a link.</p>
			<p> Everything you put the project page is synced live.</p>
			<ul>
				<li> Watch as people check off tasks, live.</li>
				<li> Add polls to decide on meeting times, locations, and more</li>
				<li> Access everything from any smartphone.</li>
			</ul>
